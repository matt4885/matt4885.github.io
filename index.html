    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Technical Architect with many years of experience designing and
      developing full stack, business oriented applications. I have four years
      of experience running and leading teams to deliver quality software on
      time. I mostly work with React, TypeScript, Node.js, .NET and MongoDB. I
      also have previous experience with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Python 3 and
      Rust.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</h3>
    <h4>Technical Architect (2022-Present)</h4>
    <p>
      Technical Architect for building backend services that the business used
      (suite of user serivces such as Authentication, Authorization, File
      Uploading and User Profile Management) as well as delivering front end,
      design system components. I managed multiple developers, quality assurance
      testers, and interacted with the business in a SAFe Agile approach to
      ensure software was delivered on time and up to the quality end users
      would expect.
    </p>
    <h4>Software Developer (2018-2023)</h4>
    <p>
      Built a variety of business applications leverging .NET,
      TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
      and MemSQL/SingleStore. A lot of my work was on the backend, building APIs
      and services that powered our business and analytical tools. I also worked
      on full stack applications, mostly with React, and a bit with Angular.
      This meant I was involved in all parts of the project, from start to
      finish, ensuring everything worked together seamlessly. My broad skill set
      in full stack development played a key role in our teamâ€™s achievements.
    </p>
    <h4>DevOps Engineer (2016-2018)</h4>
    <p>
      Responsible for ensuring build/deployment pipelines and environments were
      prepared for production usage. As a DevOps engineer, I pioneered the usage
      of Docker and application containerization standards (Docker Machine and
      eventually Kubernetes) as well as managed production databases to ensure
      there was no application downtime due to server updates or emergencies. I
      also wrote installers for legacy Windows Server deployments using AutoIt
      and PowerShell.
