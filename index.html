        I am a Technical Architect with many years of experience designing and

        of experience running and leading software development teams to deliver
        quality software on time. I mostly work with React, TypeScript, Node.js,

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</h3>
      <h4>Technical Architect (2022-Present)</h4>
      <p>
        Technical Architect for building backend services that the business used
        (suite of user serivces such as Authentication, Authorization, File
        Uploading and User Profile Management) as well as delivering front end,
        design system components. I managed multiple developers, quality
        assurance testers, and interacted with the business in a SAFe Agile
        approach to ensure software was delivered on time and up to the quality
        end users would expect.
      </p>
      <h4>Software Developer (2018-2023)</h4>
      <p>
        Built a variety of business applications leverging .NET,
        TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
        and MemSQL/SingleStore. A lot of my work was on the backend, building
        APIs and services that powered our business and analytical tools. I also
        worked on full stack applications, mostly with React, and a bit with
        Angular. This meant I was involved in all parts of the project, from
        start to finish, ensuring everything worked together seamlessly. My
        broad skill set in full stack development played a key role in our
        teamâ€™s achievements.
      </p>
      <h4>DevOps Engineer (2016-2018)</h4>
      <p>
        Responsible for ensuring build/deployment pipelines and environments
        were prepared for production usage. As a DevOps engineer, I pioneered
        the usage of Docker and application containerization standards (Docker
        Machine and eventually Kubernetes) as well as managed production
        databases to ensure there was no application downtime due to server
        updates or emergencies. I also wrote installers for legacy Windows
        Server deployments using AutoIt and PowerShell.
